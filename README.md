Virtua Partner
==============

Progmatic Windows keyboard inputs to make sparring partner in Virtua Fighter.

## System Requirements

* Windows 10
* Visual Studio 2019 (for compiling and running)
* Virtua Fighter 5 Final Tuned running in a window

## Features

- Trigger keyboard inputs progmatically to act as a sparring partner in Virtua Fighter 5 Final Tuned

- Detects when you block a move with guaranteed punishment and gives feedback on if you punish or not

## Limitations

**CPU Commands**

Only a few characters and situations are configured right now.

**CPU Inputs**

CPU inputs must be mapped as follows keyboard keys (this is hardcoded for now)
* Up: W
* Left: A
* Down: S
* Right: D
* Guard: G
* Punch: P
* Kick: K

**Guaranteed Punishment Feedback**

This is a work in progress and basically it only gives feedback as if you were playing as El Blaze.  Though the feedback for punch counterable moves should be accurate for other characters where PK is guarenteed at +12 or +13.
